Why is Agile not enough?

### The ordinary world

In software we have project stuff and technical stuff that helps us deliver working software
As an organization we've progressed well on the project stuff, we have adopted practices like scrum, kanban, stand ups, backlogs, user stories, retrospectives etc.
We have re-organized teams along customer lines (alliances)
We even have a role in the organization called an 'agile coach', who focusses on helping us change our interactions
From technical perspective there has not been such a radical change, in many instances we are still writing code in the same style of yester years. 
We are still learning the same way we learn't years several years ago.

### Call to adventure

We need to embrace technical techniques and practices that let us change direction quickly and confidently.
We need to improve ourselves technically to be able develop systems that are able to change at the same cadence that our interactions are.
The key to success is not just about changing our interactions, it is also about us changing how we fundamentally make things, the not so visible things.

### Refusal of the call

As managers
We have also tried to support our technical people in continous learning, we pay for PluralSight Licenses, send people to conferences and pay for workshops.
You think that the techniques like TDD, Refactoring, Automation are great in theory, but in the real world they are not practical
You don't need to change how you make things, this is just a fad that will eventually go away.
The system you are working on now is stuck system, I cannot change it until we upgrade to technology X, it's just too hard the way it is now
You are too busy trying to deliver business features to have time to learn how to change how you do things technically

### Meeting with the mentor

How are we growing technical excellence.

### Crossing the threshold

#### Tests

* Your business stakeholders are putting massive pressure on you to meet a deadline, you need to get the next feature out by X date or else there will be major consequences
* You are asked to work on a system where it is near impossible to do these things, the technology is old, it doesn't have the tools you need
* You work with other developers who do not value these things, they tell you it's a fad that there is nothing wrong with how things are done right now

#### Allies

* Platform manifesto & platform principles
* Other like minded software professionals scattered across the organization

#### Enemies

* People who do their own thing, believe that they are good enough
*


### Approach

### Ordeal

### Reward

### The Road Back

### Resurrection Hero

* A seasoned professional who is able to consistently and reliably roll out quality software that can adequately respond to change

### Return with Elixir

Agile is not going to save you!

Now, before you label me a heretic, let me explain what I mean. I was first introduced to 'agile' in 2011 and have been a fan of agile principles ever since. 

In fact, some of my friends would label me a agile fanboy. I've read agile books, run agile simulations, attend agile workshops, speak at agile conferences and even had a scrum master certification! 

So why the agile hate?

Over the last five years I've seen a mindset emerge that really worries me - it seems to stem largely from the management side of organizations and it goes something like this.... If we get agile right our problems around software development will be solved. 

Today I would like to explore one reason why that mindset is so dangerous.

# What do we mean about agile

The first thing I would like to ask is what do we think of when we say agile? Is agile a family of processes? Is it a product we can buy? Is it a mindset or culture?

The reality is agile means different things to different people. For instance, over the last few months I have been involved in interviewing a lot of people for software development positions. One of the questions I love to ask is what does agile mean to them. I've been surprised by the responses. 

I put most of the responses into one of three buckets

Agile is Scrum - for many when I ask them what agile is, they talk to me about, Scrum - for them agile is a specific process with a sprint with a set of meetings.
Agile is a Scrum, Kanban & Lean - For others they go beyond this to include other process methodologies, they might mention that agile can be Kanban or Scrum or a mix of them.
Agile is a set of values - The third group tends to talk about values, around agile being about getting quick feedback or not having hard requirements.


When I was first introduced to agile it meant creating software in a way that you could respond quickly to change. This was applicable at all levels, from the code you wrote to the way you defined your requirements and interacted as a team. Sadly, now days when I ask people what they think about when they I say agile they talk to me about standups, user stories, cross functional teams, iterations and sprints. 



Martin Fowler, one of the original agile manifesto signatories, said the following:

"One of the common problems is we take the project management stuff, but we don't have the technical stuff. That's because we don't have software that is designed for change. This is particularly a problem in the scrum world"
