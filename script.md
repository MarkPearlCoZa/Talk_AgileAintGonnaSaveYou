Agile is not going to save you!

Now, before you label me a heretic, let me explain what I mean. I was first introduced to 'agile' in 2011 and have been a fan of agile principles ever since. 

In fact, some of my friends would label me a agile fanboy. I've read agile books, run agile simulations, attended agile workshops, spoken at agile conferences and even been a been a scrum master! 

So why the agile hate?

Over the last five years I've seen a mindset emerge from many managers that really worries me - agile has become their mythical silver bullet, something that if their people could just do right all their software problems would go away.

Today I would like to challenge that mindset.

# What do we mean about agile

The first thing is what do we mean when we say agile?

Well turns out this is a loaded word. Agile means different things to different people. When I was first introduced to agile it meant creating software in a way that you could respond quickly to change. This was applicable at all levels, from the code you wrote to the way you defined your requirements and interacted as a team. Sadly, now days when I ask people what they think about when they I say agile they talk to me about standups, user stories, cross functional teams, iterations and sprints. 



Martin Fowler, one of the original agile manifesto signatories, said the following:

"One of the common problems is we take the project management stuff, but we don't have the technical stuff. That's because we don't have software that is designed for change. This is particularly a problem in the scrum world"
