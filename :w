### The ordinary world

The ordinary world is a place where we are doing being agile we speak about being able to but we haven't really changed how we make software. 
We are still code that is resistant to change

### Call to adventure

Software is not just about changing our interactions, it is also about us changing how we make things

### Refusal of the call

Management isn't able to help us. They provide tools like video learnings and conferences where we learn about technology. Very rarely do we learn about the deeper princples around creating software.

### Meeting with the mentor



### Crossing the threshold

Tests, allies, enemies

### Approach

### Ordeal

### Reward

### The Road Back

### Resurrection Hero

### Return with Elixir

Agile is not going to save you!

Now, before you label me a heretic, let me explain what I mean. I was first introduced to 'agile' in 2011 and have been a fan of agile principles ever since. 

In fact, some of my friends would label me a agile fanboy. I've read agile books, run agile simulations, attend agile workshops, speak at agile conferences and even had a scrum master certification! 

So why the agile hate?

Over the last five years I've seen a mindset emerge that really worries me - it seems to stem largely from the management side of organizations and it goes something like this.... If we get agile right our problems around software development will be solved. 

Today I would like to explore one reason why that mindset is so dangerous.

# What do we mean about agile

The first thing I would like to ask is what do we think of when we say agile? Is agile a family of processes? Is it a product we can buy? Is it a mindset or culture?

The reality is agile means different things to different people. For instance, over the last few months I have been involved in interviewing a lot of people for software development positions. One of the questions I love to ask is what does agile mean to them. I've been surprised by the responses. 

I put most of the responses into one of three buckets

Agile is Scrum - for many when I ask them what agile is, they talk to me about, Scrum - for them agile is a specific process with a sprint with a set of meetings.
Agile is a Scrum, Kanban & Lean - For others they go beyond this to include other process methodologies, they might mention that agile can be Kanban or Scrum or a mix of them.
Agile is a set of values - The third group tends to talk about values, around agile being about getting quick feedback or not having hard requirements.


When I was first introduced to agile it meant creating software in a way that you could respond quickly to change. This was applicable at all levels, from the code you wrote to the way you defined your requirements and interacted as a team. Sadly, now days when I ask people what they think about when they I say agile they talk to me about standups, user stories, cross functional teams, iterations and sprints. 



Martin Fowler, one of the original agile manifesto signatories, said the following:

"One of the common problems is we take the project management stuff, but we don't have the technical stuff. That's because we don't have software that is designed for change. This is particularly a problem in the scrum world"
